Genocide 1.2GhzOC EC05 Kernel
for Samsung Epic 4G (EC05, DK28, and EB13 compatible)

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=961614

How to compile: 
If you do not have the toolchain then get it from codesourcery.com and install/extract.  Since I am compiling on an Ubuntu VM I use http://www.codesourcery.com/public/gnu_toolchain/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q3-67-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Browse to Kernel/arch/arm/configs/ and edit victory_03_defconfig and change the path for CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=
Then refer to the README.txt on what else you need to change.
